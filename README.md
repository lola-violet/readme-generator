## Installation 
Before installing, please make sure you have node.js installed locally. If you don't already have node.js, you can download it via their [website](https://nodejs.dev/). After cloning this repo, open the integrated terminal in VS Code & install the npm inquirer package. A package.json file already exists with listed dependencies, so you can simply enter "npm install" to acquire the package.

---

## Usage
Once you've completed the necessary installations, you can create your README. To run the application, open the integrated terminal & enter "node index.js". You'll be prompted with a series of questions about your project. Answer each question, and the README file will appear in your directory when all are complete. If there's a section you don't have information for, press enter to move on to the next question. When the README file appears in your directory, you can open the file & make any edits necessary for your particular project (add pictures, take out unnecessary sections, etc.). Enjoy!
