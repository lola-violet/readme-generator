## Installation 
Before installing, please make sure you have node.js installed locally. If you don't already have node.js, you can download it via their [website](https://nodejs.dev/). After cloning this repo, open the integrated terminal in VS Code & install the necessary npm packages. A package.json file already exists with listed dependencies, so you can simply enter "npm install" to acquire the packages. Next, you'll need to use mySQL to create & fill the database. Open the integrated terminal via the schema.sql file and enter "mysql -u root -p" & enter the password. Now that you're connected, run the following two commands to create & fill the database: "SOURCE schema.sql;" then "SOURCE seeds.sql;". Next, return to the integrated terminal where you installed the npm packages, and enter "npm start" to run the application.

## Usage
Once you've installed the necessary packages & created the mySQL database, you can begin to use the application. To start, enter "npm start" in the integrated terminal. You will be prompted with a list of actions to choose from. To view a table that shows all of the current departments, select "View All Departments"
